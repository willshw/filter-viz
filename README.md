# Filtering Using Mouse Position Input

#### This repository was initiated to study and code the filters for estimation base only using a simple mouse position input on the computer. No real motion model was used. By changing the parameters of the filters, one can observe the change in the estimation of mouse position. I hope this can be useful for people who are trying to study or implement filters.
