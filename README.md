# Filter Visualizer

---

### About
This repository was initiated to study and code the filters for an estimation base on only using a mouse pointer position on the screen. By changing the parameters of the filters, one can observe the change in the estimation of the mouse position. This application can serve as a good visualizer for filters. I hope this can be useful for people who are trying to study or implement filters. GUI layout referenced [Kalman Filter Simulation](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~teammco/misc/kalman_filter/).

Kalman filter is the only filter available now. More filter can be added later in **filterLib.py**
